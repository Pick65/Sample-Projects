# Sample-Projects
Some examples of my personal codding projects.

## A* Galaxy Generator
[Separate repo link](https://github.com/Pick65/AStar-Galaxy-Generator) <br>
Above repo already has an extensive write-up about the inner workings of the project.
It even has a web version that can be played right in the browser.

## Blender batch render
[Source code](blenderBatchRender.py) <br>
Blender is a 3D modelling and rendering software.
It has a Python API that can be used to create custom plugins. <br>
In this case, I used it to automate rendering out a scene with different
textures for the object, several resolutions, and different camera angles.
It can easily be used for different projects if so desired.

## JavaScript scripts for Minecraft modding
[Source code](CustomRecipes%26BlockEvents.js) <br>
Thanks to the [KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs) 
modification for minecraft, I was able to utilize JavaScript to make changes
in various base game mechanics, and even other users modifications.
For example, in the above script, I was able to add custom recipes,
various events, when right-clicking blocks and even schedule method calls.
It greatly sped up the creation process in my personal project,
where I make a custom experience for the other players.
